      <p class="about-heading">About Me</p>
      <p class="about-main-text">Britta earned her bachelor's of science degree from Oklahoma State University and a law degree from the University of Oklahoma directly after.  She then spent the next nine years working in estate and financial planning at Houston Financial, where she worked as a liaison between the firm’s clients, their attorneys, insurance companies and investment funds.
      While at Houston Financial, Britta worked with high net worth individuals and business owners, and increased the company’s Assets Under Management from $18 million to $80 million. <br><br> In 2012, after the birth of her son and after renovating a condo at a premier Oklahoma lakeside resort, Britta decided to pursue a career in real estate. She promptly obtained her real estate license and purchased her first investment property.  Upon completion of her first renovation project, Britta gained respect and recognition for her vision of a distressed property’s potential and the quality of work she produced.  Since then, she has completed over 38 renovations and brokered over 60 other real estate transactions.  She has forged strong relationships with several local banks, realtors, real estate investors throughout the United States,  and even converted former investment clients into private lenders. In doing so, Britta has developed a reputation for producing quality renovations, earning her the respect and admiration among her peers and colleagues throughout the real estate industry. </p>
