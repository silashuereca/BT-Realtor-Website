# BT-Realtor-Website

This project was originally built for a local realtor here in town. She wanted a website that would display her 
past work from renovating homes to current projects being worked on. However, she changed careers and decided to not go with a website! 

## Website

This project was started during my time of really learning Javascript so it's a little rough to look at but it was a huge learning experience.
